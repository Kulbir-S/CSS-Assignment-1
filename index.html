    <h2>What is CSS ?</h2>
    <br>
    
    <ul class="Z">
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet</li>
        <br>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.</li>
        <br>
        <li ><del> CSS is not necessary</del> <span class="highlight">CSS saves a lot of work.</span> It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
        <br>
        <li class="C">  External stylesheets are stored in CSS files</li>
        <br>
        <br>
    </ul>

    <h1 class="headline">CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h1>
    
    <br>
    <ul class="ul">
        
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
        <li>>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</span></li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, 
            <span class="Highlight">in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles</span>, 
            because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.</li> 
    </ul>
     <p class="A">When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.</p>
     <p class="B">In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a webpage. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the elements</p>
     <p class="A"><i>There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</i></p>
